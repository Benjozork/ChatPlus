ChatPlus
========
This is a plugin I made in the bukkit era. I just dropped this here for you guys to enjoy, I will go back to working on it if there is demand :)

Allows to mute chat and clear it, ban UPPER CASE messages, chat as another player, customize join/leave messages and more. It was completely tested for Spigot 1.8, and all the bugs have been fixed.

Available tags for join/leave messages:
- %player%, %displayname%
- %ip%
- %nbplayers%
- More coming!

Upcoming:
- Chat channels, done better than other plugins
- Improved private messaging
- Chat pause/clear/lower-casing messages will be customizable
- All the messages will be customizable

Done for 1.3a2:
- Code optimization and fixes
- Huge command handling improvements
